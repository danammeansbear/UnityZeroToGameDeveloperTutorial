### Detailed Tutorial: Implementing Checkpoint and ChangeCheckpoint Scripts ###

#### Step 1: Setting Up the Unity Scene

1. **Create a New Scene**:
   - In Unity, go to `File > New Scene` and save it as `CheckpointSystem`.

2. **Set Up the Ground**:
   - Create a plane as the ground (`GameObject > 3D Object > Plane`).
   - Rename it to "Ground" and ensure it is large enough for testing.

3. **Create the Player**:
   - Add a capsule to the scene (`GameObject > 3D Object > Capsule`).
   - Rename it "Player".
   - Add a Rigidbody component to the Player (`Inspector > Add Component > Rigidbody`).
   - Tag the Player GameObject as "Player".

#### Step 2: Adding Checkpoints

1. **Create Checkpoint GameObjects**:
   - Add empty GameObjects for each checkpoint (`GameObject > Create Empty`).
   - Rename them (e.g., "Checkpoint1", "Checkpoint2").
   - Position them at desired locations in the scene.

2. **Add Visual Markers**:
   - Add 3D objects (e.g., cubes or spheres) as visual markers at the checkpoint positions.
   - Parent the visual markers to the corresponding checkpoint GameObjects.

3. **Attach the `Checkpoint` Script**:
   - Attach the `Checkpoint.cs` script to the visual marker GameObject.
   - Assign the `checkpoint` field in the Inspector to the parent checkpoint's transform.

#### Step 3: Adding Change Checkpoints

1. **Create Change Checkpoint GameObjects**:
   - Add empty GameObjects (`GameObject > Create Empty`) at locations where the checkpoint should change.
   - Rename them (e.g., "ChangeCheckpoint1").

2. **Attach the `ChangeCheckpoint` Script**:
   - Attach the `ChangeCheckpoint.cs` script to each Change Checkpoint GameObject.
   - Assign the `checkpoint` field to the GameObject of the old checkpoint that should be destroyed.

#### Step 4: Testing the Scene

1. **Play the Game**:
   - Click the "Play" button in Unity.
   - Move the Player to trigger checkpoints and observe the Player's position and rotation resetting upon re-entering the checkpoints.

2. **Simulate Changing Checkpoints**:
   - Move the Player into a Change Checkpoint trigger and confirm the old checkpoint is destroyed.
   - Ensure subsequent re-entry of the Player at a new checkpoint works as expected.

#### Step 5: Polishing

1. **Add Feedback**:
   - Add a UI text element (`GameObject > UI > Text`) to display checkpoint activation messages.
   - Extend the scripts to show messages when a checkpoint is activated or changed.

2. **Use Gizmos for Visualization**:
   - Add Gizmo drawing in the `Checkpoint` and `ChangeCheckpoint` scripts to visualize triggers in the Scene view.
     ```csharp
     void OnDrawGizmos()
     {
         Gizmos.color = Color.green;
         Gizmos.DrawWireSphere(transform.position, 1f);
     }
     ```

3. **Customize Appearance**:
   - Change the visual markers to suit your game’s theme.
   - Add animations or particle effects to checkpoints.

#### Additional Notes
- Save your scene and project frequently to avoid data loss.
- Test edge cases, such as entering multiple checkpoints quickly or destroying checkpoints out of order.
